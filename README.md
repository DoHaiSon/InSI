## InSI
> A MatLab Toolbox for Informed System Identification in Wireless communication systems

[![Minimum Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires-R2014a-blue.svg)][matlab]

## What it is

InSI Toolbox provides a set of tools to analyse, evaluate and design complicated systems, specially in wireless communication. 

In particular, the toolbox presents some informed system identification techniques, aiming to obtain higher performance levels not allowed by the blind processing. To this end, those techniques exploits advanced semi-blind methods, high-lever information, induced properties as well as learning process. Thus, our toolbox can be used independently or in complementary way to the well-known MatLab system identification toolbox.

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.

## Features

- **Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) Mode**: this feature provides performance analysis to understand both the limitations and the needs of the considered systems. 

- **Algorithm Mode**: in the light of the previous performance bounds study, a set of efficient algorithms are introduced to achieve high performance level.

- **Demo Mode**: a "proof of concept" to illustrate and validate the obtained results for the massive MIMO system.
